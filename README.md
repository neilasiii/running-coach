# Running Coach

An AI-powered running coach that generates structured weekly training plans, publishes workouts directly to Garmin Connect, and monitors daily readiness — built on a persistent Memory OS and a Brain LLM planner.

- **VDOT-based plans** (Jack Daniels methodology) — derived from actual race performance, not Garmin's VO2max estimate
- **Garmin Connect integration** — syncs sleep, HRV, body battery, VO2 max, and activities
- **Macro plan layer** — LLM-generated 12–16 week periodization arc (base → quality → race-specific → taper) that rails the weekly planner
- **Background agent** — runs every 15 minutes; re-plans at 4am if plan is stale
- **Discord bot** — primary day-to-day interface
- **CLI** — available for headless / ops use

> **Note:** Strength, mobility, and nutrition coaching are currently stubbed. This system runs in running-only mode.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- A Garmin Connect account with a paired Garmin device
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (for AI coaching)
- A Discord bot token (optional — for the Discord interface)
- An Anthropic API key (for the Brain LLM planner)

### 1. Install Claude Code

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Verify:

```bash
claude --version
```

See the [Claude Code docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) for full setup instructions and authentication.

### 2. Clone and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neilasiii/running-coach.git
cd running-coach
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set up Garmin authentication

**Option A — Token-based (recommended for servers/bots)**

Generate tokens on a machine with browser access:

```bash
python3 bin/generate_garmin_tokens.py
```

Follow the prompts, then copy `~/.garminconnect/` to your target machine.

**Option B — Password auth (simple)**

```bash
export GARMIN_EMAIL=your@email.com
export GARMIN_PASSWORD=yourpassword
```

See [docs/GARMIN_TOKEN_AUTH.md](docs/GARMIN_TOKEN_AUTH.md) for the full authentication guide.

### 4. Configure the AI planner

```bash
cp config/gemini_api.env.example config/gemini_api.env
# Add your GEMINI_API_KEY (free tier works: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
# Used as Claude fallback — also set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in your environment
```

### 5. Set up your athlete profile

```bash
mkdir -p data/athlete
```

Create the following files (templates below):

**`data/athlete/goals.md`**
```markdown
# Primary Goal
- [Your race goal, e.g. "Run a marathon in under 4:00"]

# Secondary Goals
- Stay injury-free throughout training
- Build consistent weekly mileage
```

**`data/athlete/upcoming_races.md`**
```markdown
# Upcoming Races

## A-Race
- **Race**: [Race name]
- **Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
- **Goal Time**: [HH:MM:SS]
```

**`data/athlete/training_preferences.md`**
```markdown
# Schedule
- Available days: [e.g. Mon/Wed/Fri/Sat]
- Preferred time: [e.g. early morning]

# Constraints
- [Any childcare, work, or other scheduling constraints]
```

**`data/athlete/communication_preferences.md`**
```markdown
# Current Mode: STANDARD
# Options: BRIEF | STANDARD | DETAILED
```

### 6. Initial Garmin sync

```bash
python3 cli/coach.py sync
```

### 7. Generate your first training week

```bash
# Generate this week's plan (calls Brain LLM)
python3 cli/coach.py plan --week

# Preview Garmin workout upload (dry run — no API calls)
python3 cli/coach.py export-garmin

# See today's workout
python3 cli/coach.py brief --today

# Upload to Garmin (after reviewing dry run)
python3 cli/coach.py export-garmin --live
```

### 8. (Optional) Set up the Discord bot

```bash
cp config/discord_bot.env.example config/discord_bot.env
# Add your DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN

bash bin/start_discord_bot.sh
```

Or install as a systemd service:

```bash
# Edit deploy/running-coach-bot.service to set correct paths
sudo cp deploy/running-coach-bot.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable running-coach-bot
sudo systemctl start running-coach-bot
```

## What is Authoritative

| Layer | Role |
|---|---|
| `data/coach.sqlite` | **Authoritative source for all plan data** |
| `data/health/health_data_cache.json` | Garmin truth for all health metrics |
| `data/generated_workouts.json` | **Sole skip gate** — if a date is in this file, Garmin upload is skipped (idempotency) |
| FinalSurge / ICS calendar | Optional input to the Brain; never authoritative |
| Garmin Connect calendar | Execution layer only — receives uploads, does not drive planning |

---

## VDOT Derivation

VDOT is derived from **actual race performance** (90-day lookback), not Garmin's physiological VO2max estimate. Garmin's estimate inflates fitness by ~25–35% relative to Jack Daniels VDOT, producing unrealistic training paces.

Detection logic (`memory/retrieval.py`):
- Identifies races via standard distance bands (5k / 10k / 15k / half marathon / marathon)
- Falls back to activity name keywords (`race`, `5k`, `10k`, `half`, `marathon`, etc.)
- `vdot_race_derived` exposed in context packet alongside raw `vo2_max`
- Macro planner prefers `vdot_race_derived`; falls back to a safe default if none found

---

## Macro Plan System

The macro plan gives the weekly planner a deterministic periodization arc. It is a **rail, not a cage** — readiness can reduce weekly volume, but the macro target is the ceiling.

| Mode | Trigger | Structure |
|---|---|---|
| `race_targeted` | Future race in `upcoming_races.md` | base → quality → race_specific → taper |
| `base_block` | No future race | base → quality (12 weeks, no taper) |

**Key behaviors:**
- Cache-first: no LLM call if an active macro plan already exists (override with `--force`)
- Validation gate: 9-check structural validator runs before plan is activated (Sunday alignment, phase progression, taper rules, volume ramp ≤15%/wk, long run sanity, etc.)
- Volume ceiling: weekly planner auto-clamped to macro target (0.5 mi tolerance)
- Short-race recovery: 4-day no-quality window after races < 10 mi; no volume cap
- Long-race recovery: full cap + recovery weeks after half/marathon

```bash
python3 cli/coach.py plan --macro          # generate (cached; no LLM if active plan exists)
python3 cli/coach.py plan --macro --show   # print table of all weeks
python3 cli/coach.py plan --macro --force  # regenerate even if active plan exists
```

## Systemd Services

### Discord Bot

```bash
sudo systemctl status running-coach-bot
sudo systemctl restart running-coach-bot
sudo journalctl -u running-coach-bot -f
```

### Heartbeat Agent

```bash
sudo cp deploy/running-coach-agent.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable running-coach-agent
sudo systemctl start running-coach-agent
```

The agent runs every 15 minutes. At 4am it performs a daily deep run: writes a vault note, checks plan staleness, and re-plans if needed. Both services share a SQLite lock so they never conflict.
