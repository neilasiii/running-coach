# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This is a **running coach system** that provides personalized training guidance across four coaching domains: running, strength, mobility, and nutrition. The system integrates objective health data directly from **Garmin Connect** to inform coaching decisions with real metrics.

## Key Commands

### Health Data Management

**Garmin Connect Sync**
```bash
# Sync from Garmin Connect + show summary (recommended)
bash bin/sync_garmin_data.sh

# Sync specific number of days
bash bin/sync_garmin_data.sh --days 60

# Check what would be synced without updating cache
bash bin/sync_garmin_data.sh --check-only

# Direct Python script usage
python3 src/garmin_sync.py --summary

# Quiet mode (no output)
python3 src/garmin_sync.py --quiet

# Sync and show 30-day summary
python3 src/garmin_sync.py --days 30 --summary
```

**Environment Setup**
```bash
# Set credentials for Garmin Connect (required)
export GARMIN_EMAIL=your@email.com
export GARMIN_PASSWORD=yourpassword

# Then run sync
bash bin/sync_garmin_data.sh
```

**ICS Calendar Import (Optional)**

For importing scheduled workout dates from FinalSurge, TrainingPeaks, or other platforms:

**Option 1: Calendar URL (Recommended)**
```bash
# 1. Copy config/calendar_sources.json.example to config/calendar_sources.json
cp config/calendar_sources.json.example config/calendar_sources.json

# 2. Edit the file and add your calendar URL
# Example FinalSurge URL: https://log.finalsurge.com/delivery/ical/YOUR_ID
#   (Find this in FinalSurge under Settings → Calendar Integration)

# 3. Run sync - it will automatically download and import the calendar
bash bin/sync_garmin_data.sh
```

**Option 2: Local ICS File**
```bash
# 1. Export training calendar as .ics file from your platform
# 2. Save to data/calendar/ directory
mkdir -p data/calendar
# Place your training_calendar.ics file there

# 3. Run sync
bash bin/sync_garmin_data.sh
```

The sync will merge calendar events (with dates) with Garmin workout templates (with details) to create a complete scheduled workout plan for the next 14 days.

**ICS Calendar Export**

Export your scheduled workouts to ICS format for import into external calendar apps:

```bash
# Export next 14 days (default)
bash bin/export_calendar.sh

# Export next 30 days
bash bin/export_calendar.sh --days 30

# Export to custom location
bash bin/export_calendar.sh --output ~/Downloads/my_workouts.ics

# Quiet mode (no output except errors)
bash bin/export_calendar.sh --quiet

# Export during sync (automatic)
python3 src/garmin_sync.py --export-calendar --export-days 21

# Direct Python usage
python3 src/ics_exporter.py --days 14 --output data/calendar/workouts.ics
```

The exported .ics file can be imported into:
- **Google Calendar**: Settings → Import & Export → Import → Select file
- **Outlook**: File → Open & Export → Import/Export → Import an iCalendar (.ics) file
- **Apple Calendar**: File → Import → Select file

**Workout Library**

Browse and search the pre-built workout library:

```bash
# View library statistics
bash bin/workout_library.sh stats

# List all workouts
bash bin/workout_library.sh list

# Search for specific workouts
bash bin/workout_library.sh search --domain running --type tempo
bash bin/workout_library.sh search --difficulty beginner --duration-max 30
bash bin/workout_library.sh search --tags gluten_free dairy_free

# Get detailed workout information
bash bin/workout_library.sh get <workout-id>

# See all search options
bash bin/workout_library.sh search --help
```

The library contains 19+ pre-built workouts across all domains (running, strength, mobility, nutrition) with searchable metadata.

**Communication Preferences**

Control the level of detail in coaching responses:

```bash
# View current communication preference (BRIEF/STANDARD/DETAILED)
head -5 data/athlete/communication_preferences.md

# Or just ask the coach to change modes
# "Switch to brief mode"
# "Give me detailed explanations"
# "Use standard detail level"
```

**Detail Levels:**
- **BRIEF** (default): Concise workouts with just time/intensity/pace - minimal explanations
- **STANDARD**: Balanced detail with brief rationale and purpose statements
- **DETAILED**: Comprehensive explanations with physiological reasoning and multiple options

See [docs/COMMUNICATION_PREFERENCES_GUIDE.md](docs/COMMUNICATION_PREFERENCES_GUIDE.md) for examples and usage guide.

### Database Management

The system uses PostgreSQL for persistent storage and Redis for caching and background jobs.

**Initialize Database**
```bash
# Create all database tables
bash bin/db_init.sh

# Or using Python directly
python3 src/database/init_db.py create
```

**Migrate Data from JSON and Markdown**
```bash
# Migrate all data (workouts, health data, athlete data) to PostgreSQL
bash bin/db_migrate.sh

# Or migrate specific types only
bash bin/db_migrate.sh --workouts-only  # Just workouts and health data
bash bin/db_migrate.sh --athlete-only   # Just athlete data

# Or using Python directly
python3 src/database/migrate_json_to_db.py      # Workouts and health data
python3 src/database/migrate_athlete_data.py    # Athlete profile and preferences
```

**Manage Athlete Data**
```bash
# View athlete information
bash bin/athlete_data.sh show-profile      # Profile info
bash bin/athlete_data.sh show-status       # Current training status
bash bin/athlete_data.sh show-prefs        # Communication preferences
bash bin/athlete_data.sh list-races        # List all races
bash bin/athlete_data.sh list-docs         # List athlete documents

# Migrate athlete data
bash bin/athlete_data.sh migrate
```

**Manage Users (Multi-Athlete Support)**
```bash
# View users and associations
bash bin/manage_users.sh list-users         # List all users
bash bin/manage_users.sh list-athletes      # List all athletes
bash bin/manage_users.sh list-associations  # User-athlete links

# Create users and associations
bash bin/manage_users.sh create-user <username> <email> <name>
bash bin/manage_users.sh link-athlete <user_id> <athlete_id>
```

**Manage Training Plans**
```bash
# Migrate existing plans from markdown
bash bin/manage_plans.sh migrate

# View training plans
bash bin/manage_plans.sh list               # All plans
bash bin/manage_plans.sh list-active        # Active plans only
bash bin/manage_plans.sh show <plan_id>     # Plan details
bash bin/manage_plans.sh by-athlete <id>    # Plans for athlete
bash bin/manage_plans.sh by-race <race_id>  # Plans for race
```

**Database Access**
```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL
docker exec -it running-coach-postgres psql -U coach -d running_coach

# Common queries
\dt                           # List tables
\d workouts                   # Describe workouts table
SELECT * FROM activities LIMIT 5;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM workouts;
\q                            # Exit

# Connect to Redis
docker exec -it running-coach-redis redis-cli
KEYS *                        # List all keys
GET health:activities:recent:10
exit
```

**Database Management**
```bash
# Reset database (WARNING: deletes all data!)
python3 src/database/init_db.py reset

# Backup PostgreSQL
docker exec running-coach-postgres pg_dump -U coach running_coach > backup.sql

# Restore PostgreSQL
docker exec -i running-coach-postgres psql -U coach running_coach < backup.sql

# View logs
docker-compose logs postgres
docker-compose logs redis
```

See [docs/DATABASE_GUIDE.md](docs/DATABASE_GUIDE.md) for complete database documentation.

### Testing

**Verify Health Data System**
```bash
# Verify cache status
cat data/health/health_data_cache.json | python3 -m json.tool | head -50

# Check recent activities
cat data/health/health_data_cache.json | python3 -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(f\"Activities: {len(d['activities'])}\")"
```

## Architecture

### Coaching Agent System

Four specialized coaching agents are defined in [.claude/agents/](.claude/agents/):

1. **[vdot-running-coach.md](.claude/agents/vdot-running-coach.md)** - Running workouts, pacing, periodization (Jack Daniels VDOT methodology)
2. **[runner-strength-coach.md](.claude/agents/runner-strength-coach.md)** - Strength training for runners, coordinated with running schedule
3. **[mobility-coach-runner.md](.claude/agents/mobility-coach-runner.md)** - Mobility and recovery protocols for distance running
4. **[endurance-nutrition-coach.md](.claude/agents/endurance-nutrition-coach.md)** - Nutrition and fueling for endurance training

All agents share access to athlete context files in [data/](data/) and the health data system.

### Health Data Pipeline

**Database-First Architecture**
```
Garmin Connect API (garminconnect library)
           ↓
src/garmin_sync.py (authenticate & fetch)
           ↓
PostgreSQL Database (persistent storage)
           ↓
Redis Cache (fast lookups, 24hr TTL)
           ↓
Coaching Agents (query database/cache for decisions)
```

**Legacy JSON Support**:
- JSON files in data/health/ maintained for backward compatibility
- Can be migrated to database using `bash bin/db_migrate.sh`
- Database is now the primary source of truth

**Key Design Principles**:
- Direct API access - no intermediate CSV files or manual exports
- OAuth authentication via garminconnect library (tokens cached in ~/.garminconnect)
- Incremental updates - tracks last sync date to avoid refetching all historical data
- Database transactions - atomic updates with rollback on errors
- Redis caching - fast access to frequently queried data
- De-duplication by timestamp/ID - safe to re-sync date ranges

### Athlete Context and Data Storage

**Primary Data Source**: All athlete data is stored in **PostgreSQL** database tables:
- `athlete_profiles` - Core athlete information
- `training_status` - Current VDOT, paces, phase (with version history)
- `communication_preferences` - Detail level and format preferences
- `races` - Race schedule with goals and strategies
- `athlete_documents` - Goals, history, preferences (with version tracking)
- `activities`, `sleep_sessions`, etc. - Health metrics from Garmin Connect

Coaching agents should query the database using the Python database API. See [docs/DATABASE_GUIDE.md](docs/DATABASE_GUIDE.md) for details.

**Markdown Files** (Human-Readable Reference):

The following files in [data/athlete/](data/athlete/) provide human-readable views of athlete data and are maintained for convenience:

- **[goals.md](data/athlete/goals.md)** - Performance goals, training objectives
- **[communication_preferences.md](data/athlete/communication_preferences.md)** - Detail level (BRIEF/STANDARD/DETAILED) and response format preferences
- **[training_history.md](data/athlete/training_history.md)** - Injury history, past training patterns
- **[training_preferences.md](data/athlete/training_preferences.md)** - Schedule constraints, dietary requirements (gluten-free, dairy-free)
- **[upcoming_races.md](data/athlete/upcoming_races.md)** - Race schedule, time goals, taper timing
- **[current_training_status.md](data/athlete/current_training_status.md)** - Current VDOT, training paces, phase status
- **[health_profile.md](data/athlete/health_profile.md)** - Human-readable health summary

These markdown files are synchronized from the database and can be read when programmatic database access is not convenient. For production coaching logic, prefer querying the database directly.

## Health Data Integration

### When Agents Should Check Health Data

Coaching agents should run `bash bin/sync_garmin_data.sh` when:
1. Beginning a coaching session
2. User mentions completing a workout
3. Making recovery-based recommendations
4. Adjusting training based on fatigue/readiness
5. User mentions new health data is available

This automatically:
- Fetches latest data from Garmin Connect API
- Updates the local cache
- Provides a summary of recent activity

### Authentication

The Garmin sync requires credentials to be set as environment variables:

```bash
export GARMIN_EMAIL=your@email.com
export GARMIN_PASSWORD=yourpassword
```

The garminconnect library handles OAuth authentication and stores tokens in `~/.garminconnect/` for persistent access (valid for ~1 year).

### Using Health Data in Coaching Decisions

**Database Access (Preferred):**
```python
from src.database.connection import get_session
from src.database.models import Activity, SleepSession, RestingHRReading
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Get recent activities
with get_session() as session:
    recent_runs = session.query(Activity)\
        .filter(Activity.activity_type == 'RUNNING')\
        .order_by(Activity.start_time.desc())\
        .limit(5)\
        .all()

    # Check recent RHR trend for recovery assessment
    week_ago = datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(days=7)
    recent_rhr = session.query(RestingHRReading)\
        .filter(RestingHRReading.reading_date >= week_ago)\
        .order_by(RestingHRReading.reading_date.desc())\
        .all()
    avg_rhr = sum(r.resting_hr for r in recent_rhr) / len(recent_rhr)

    # RHR elevated >5 bpm → recommend easy day
    # RHR elevated 3-5 bpm → reduce intensity
```

**Redis Cache (Fast Lookups):**
```python
from src.database.redis_cache import RedisCache

cache = RedisCache()

# Get cached recent activities
recent_activities = cache.get_recent_activities(limit=10)

# Get cached sleep data
recent_sleep = cache.get_recent_sleep(days=7)

# Check sleep quality
last_night = recent_sleep[0] if recent_sleep else None
if last_night:
    sleep_score = last_night.get('sleep_score', 0)
    total_hrs = last_night.get('total_duration_minutes', 0) / 60
    # Sleep <6.5 hrs or score <60 → consider conservative adjustment
```

**Legacy JSON Access (Backward Compatibility):**
```python
# JSON files are maintained for backward compatibility
import json
with open('data/health/health_data_cache.json', 'r') as f:
    cache = json.load(f)
# ... same access patterns as before
```

### Supported Data Types

All data is fetched directly from Garmin Connect API:

- **Activities**: Date, distance, duration, pace, avg/max HR, calories, splits, **HR zones** (time-in-zone per activity) - running, walking
- **Sleep**: Total duration, light/deep/REM/awake minutes, sleep score (0-100)
- **VO2 Max**: Garmin estimates (ml/kg/min)
- **Lactate Threshold**: Auto-detected threshold HR (bpm) and pace - **NEW**
- **Weight**: Body weight (lbs), body fat %, muscle % when available
- **Resting Heart Rate**: Daily RHR (bpm) - key recovery indicator
- **HRV**: Heart rate variability daily summaries with baseline ranges
- **Training Readiness**: Daily readiness score (0-100) with recovery time and contributing factors
- **Body Battery**: Energy charged/drained throughout the day
- **Stress**: All-day stress levels (avg/max)

## Important Implementation Details

### Garmin Connect Sync
- Uses garminconnect Python library (garth-based OAuth)
- Credentials via environment variables (GARMIN_EMAIL, GARMIN_PASSWORD)
- Tokens stored in ~/.garminconnect/ (valid for ~1 year)
- Fetches data via API calls (no CSV parsing needed)
- Supports incremental sync by date range

### Data Caching
- Atomic cache updates (write to temp file, then rename)
- Safe to run multiple times - won't create duplicates
- De-duplicates by timestamp automatically
- Tracks last_sync_date for incremental updates
- Sorted newest-first for easy access to recent data

### Agent Coordination
- All agents use same athlete context files for consistency
- Health data provides objective feedback loop across all domains
- Agents should proactively suggest updates to context files when athlete circumstances change

## Athlete-Specific Context

### Schedule Constraints
- Works Mon-Thu, 0700-1730 (in-office)
- Has 3 hours/week of work-granted fitness time (typically morning sessions ~0715)
- Prefers early morning workouts on workdays
- Weekend flexibility for long runs (Saturday) and mobility (Sunday)

### Dietary Requirements
- **Gluten-free** (required)
- **Dairy-free** (required)
- All nutrition recommendations must respect these constraints

### Training Philosophy
- Jack Daniels VDOT methodology for running paces
- Time-based workouts preferred over distance
- Periodized training: Base → Early Quality → Race-Specific → Taper
- Conservative adjustments when sleep/recovery compromised
- Strength training supports running (doesn't compete with it)

### Current Status (as of system setup)
- Training for marathon goal of 4:00 (9:10/mi pace)
- Recent training: ~65 miles over 14 days
- VO2 max: 51.0
- Resting HR: 46 bpm average
- Managing newborn care (sleep variability expected)

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
1. Verify environment variables are set:
   ```bash
   echo $GARMIN_EMAIL
   echo $GARMIN_PASSWORD
   ```
2. Try re-authenticating by removing token cache:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.garminconnect
   bash bin/sync_garmin_data.sh
   ```
3. Check Garmin Connect account status (ensure not locked)

### Health Data Not Updating
1. Check authentication (see above)
2. Run with verbose output to see errors:
   ```bash
   python3 src/garmin_sync.py --days 7 --summary
   ```
3. Verify cache timestamp:
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import json; print(json.load(open('data/health/health_data_cache.json'))['last_updated'])"
   ```
4. Check Garmin Connect API status (may be temporarily unavailable)

### Duplicate Entries
- System automatically de-duplicates by timestamp
- Re-syncing same date range is safe (won't create duplicates)
- Data merged by date/timestamp keys

### Resetting Cache
```bash
# Complete reset (deletes all cached data)
rm data/health/health_data_cache.json

# Then re-sync (e.g., 90 days of history)
bash bin/sync_garmin_data.sh --days 90
```

### Missing Data
- Some data types may not be available on all days (e.g., weight, VO2 max)
- Sleep data requires Garmin device with sleep tracking
- VO2 max requires GPS activities with heart rate data
- Check Garmin Connect web/app to verify data is actually available

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Features

When implementing new features, ALWAYS update the following files:

1. **README.md** - Add to appropriate section:
   - **Features section** - Brief description of the feature
   - **Usage section** - How to use the feature with examples
   - **Documentation section** - Link to any new documentation
   - **Project Structure** - Update directory tree if new files/folders added
   - **Roadmap** - Mark feature as completed `[x]` if it was on the roadmap

2. **CLAUDE.md** (this file) - Update:
   - **Key Commands** section if new CLI commands added
   - **Architecture** section if new components added
   - **Documentation** section with links to new guides
   - **Athlete Context Files** if new context files added

3. **Documentation** - Create comprehensive guides:
   - User-facing guides in `docs/` directory
   - Include examples for all usage patterns
   - Provide troubleshooting sections
   - Link guides from README.md and CLAUDE.md

4. **Agent Prompts** - Update all relevant agents in `.claude/agents/`:
   - Add new context files to required reading lists
   - Update instructions for new capabilities
   - Include examples of how to use new features
   - Maintain consistency across all agents

### Documentation Standards

- Use clear, concise language
- Provide working code examples
- Include both simple and advanced usage patterns
- Add troubleshooting sections for common issues
- Keep examples consistent with actual implementation
- Update all cross-references when renaming/moving files
