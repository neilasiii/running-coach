# Shared Agent Context

This document contains instructions and context that apply to ALL coaching agents (running, strength, mobility, nutrition). Each agent should reference this instead of duplicating these instructions.

---

## Critical: Date Verification Protocol

**MANDATORY FOR ALL AGENTS:**

1. **NEVER assume or guess today's date or day-of-week**
2. **ALWAYS call `get_current_date` at the start of EVERY coaching session**
3. **ALWAYS call `calculate_date_info` to verify day-of-week** for any date you reference
4. **If user corrects your date/day-of-week, STOP and acknowledge the correction**

**Why this is critical:** Date errors undermine trust and lead to incorrect workout scheduling.

## Smart Sync Protocol

**At session start, ALWAYS call `smart_sync_health_data`:**

This tool intelligently checks cache age before syncing:
- Cache <30 min old → Uses cached data (fast, no API call)
- Cache >30 min old → Syncs from Garmin Connect (fresh data)
- User mentions "just finished workout" → Use `force=true` parameter

**Benefits:**
- Reduces redundant API calls when multiple agents run in quick succession
- Faster response times with cached data
- Still ensures fresh data when needed

**Parameters:**
- `max_age_minutes` (default: 30) - max cache age before syncing
- `force` (default: false) - force sync regardless of cache age

## FinalSurge Workout Priority Rules

**CRITICAL: ALL AGENTS MUST FOLLOW THIS PRIORITY:**

1. **FinalSurge scheduled workouts** (Priority 1 - ALWAYS use these)
   - Location: `health_data_cache.json` → `scheduled_workouts` array
   - Source: `"source": "ics_calendar"` indicates from FinalSurge
   - These are the athlete's current training plan decisions

2. **Baseline plan workouts** (Priority 2 - fallback only)
   - Location: `data/plans/planned_workouts.json`
   - Use ONLY when no FinalSurge workout exists for that date
   - Represents general training framework, not current decisions

**When checking today's workout:**
1. First check `health_data_cache.json` → `scheduled_workouts` for FinalSurge entry
2. If FinalSurge workout found → use it, baseline plan is superseded
3. If no FinalSurge workout → check `planned_workouts.json` for baseline plan
4. Document deviations when FinalSurge differs from baseline plan

---

## FinalSurge Lookahead Rule (ALL AGENTS)

When recommending ANY workout that's not from FinalSurge (baseline plan or custom suggestion):

**YOU MUST:**
1. Check upcoming FinalSurge workouts (next 7-14 days)
2. Ensure recommendation doesn't interfere with running coach's planned schedule
3. Adjust to support, not compromise, FinalSurge quality workouts

**Domain-specific lookahead:**

### Running Coach
- Easy runs: Can fill gaps between FinalSurge workouts
- Quality work: Only if no FinalSurge workout scheduled
- Volume additions: Must not compromise upcoming FinalSurge quality

### Strength Coach
- Heavy lower body: 48+ hours before FinalSurge quality running
- Light maintenance: 24+ hours before FinalSurge quality running
- FinalSurge workouts are IMMOVABLE - strength works around them

### Mobility Coach
- Light mobility (10-20 min): Any time - supports all training
- Intensive mobility (40+ min): Avoid day before FinalSurge quality (may cause stiffness)
- Post-run mobility: Always encouraged after any running

### Nutrition Coach
- Day before FinalSurge quality: Adequate carbs, familiar foods, good hydration
- Morning of FinalSurge quality: Pre-run fueling 2-3 hrs before
- Easy days: Opportunity to experiment with race-day nutrition strategies

## Communication Detail Levels

**ALWAYS check `data/athlete/communication_preferences.md` at session start** to determine the athlete's preferred detail level.

### BRIEF Mode
- Concise, schedule-focused responses
- Workout prescriptions in compact format (time, intensity, pace)
- Minimal explanatory text
- No modification options unless asked
- Example: "Tomorrow: 45 min E (10:00-11:10). Tue: 15 min E warmup, 3x10 min T (8:35) w/ 2 min jog, 10 min E cooldown."

### STANDARD Mode (Default)
- Balanced detail with context
- Brief rationale for workouts
- Short purpose statements
- Mention key recovery considerations
- Example: "Tomorrow: 45 min E (10:00-11:10) for recovery. Tue: Threshold - 15 min E, 3x10 min T (8:35) w/ 2 min jog, 10 min E. Purpose: lactate threshold development."

### DETAILED Mode
- Comprehensive explanations
- Full physiological reasoning
- Multiple modification options (conservative/moderate/full)
- Environmental and scheduling considerations
- Coordination notes with other training domains

**The athlete can change detail level at any time** by asking directly (e.g., "switch to brief mode").

## Planned Workouts System

The athlete's baseline training plan has been extracted into `data/plans/planned_workouts.json`. This contains all scheduled workouts with dates, domains, and details.

**Check workouts using CLI:**

```bash
# Today's scheduled workout
bash bin/planned_workouts.sh list --today -v

# Upcoming workouts (next 7 days)
bash bin/planned_workouts.sh list --upcoming 7 -v

# Mark workout completed
bash bin/planned_workouts.sh complete <workout-id> \
  --duration 30 --distance 3.1 --pace "10:20/mile" --hr 140

# Add adjustment to workout
bash bin/planned_workouts.sh adjust <workout-id> \
  --reason "Recovery metrics show elevated RHR" \
  --change "Reduced from 45 min to 30 min" \
  --modified-by "agent-name"
```

**When to use planned workouts:**
- Check today's scheduled workout at session start (FinalSurge first, then baseline)
- Review weekly adherence and completion rates
- Mark workouts complete with actual performance data
- Document adjustments with clear reasoning

## Health Data Available

After calling `smart_sync_health_data`, the cache (`data/health/health_data_cache.json`) contains:

**Activity Data:**
- Recent activities (running, strength, cycling, swimming, etc.)
- Metrics: date, distance, duration, pace, avg/max HR, calories, splits
- HR zones (time-in-zone per activity)

**Recovery Metrics:**
- Sleep: total duration, light/deep/REM/awake minutes, sleep score (0-100)
- Resting Heart Rate (RHR): daily values - key recovery indicator
- HRV: heart rate variability with baseline ranges
- Training Readiness: daily score (0-100) with recovery time and factors
- Body Battery: energy charged/drained throughout day
- Stress: all-day stress levels (avg/max)

**Performance Indicators:**
- VO2 Max: Garmin estimates (ml/kg/min)
- Lactate Threshold: auto-detected threshold HR and pace
- Training Load: ATL, CTL, TSB (form/fitness/fatigue)
- Race Predictions: current estimated race times

**Other Metrics:**
- Weight: body weight, body fat %, muscle mass
- Gear Stats: equipment mileage (shoe replacement alerts)
- Daily Steps: overall activity level
- Scheduled Workouts: upcoming FinalSurge workouts

## Tool Usage Patterns

**When to call `calculate_date_info`:**
- When creating schedules, call for 2-3 key dates to verify accuracy
- Then infer sequential dates to save time
- Don't call for every single date in a multi-week plan

**When to save training plans:**
- Use `save_training_plan` for multi-day or multi-week plans
- Include filename and markdown content
- Plans saved to `data/plans/` directory

**When to get weather:**
- Before outdoor workout recommendations
- When assessing running conditions
- For pacing adjustments (heat/humidity)
- Clothing and hydration recommendations

## Required Reading for All Agents

Before providing any guidance, ALL agents MUST read:

1. `data/athlete/goals.md` - Performance goals, training objectives
2. `data/athlete/communication_preferences.md` - Detail level preference
3. `data/athlete/training_history.md` - Injury history, past patterns
4. `data/athlete/training_preferences.md` - Schedule, diet, preferences
5. `data/athlete/upcoming_races.md` - Race calendar, priorities
6. `data/athlete/current_training_status.md` - Current VDOT, paces, phase
7. `data/health/health_data_cache.json` - Objective health metrics
8. `data/plans/planned_workouts.json` - Scheduled baseline workouts

See `data/athlete/README.md` for file organization principles.

This shared context ensures consistency across all coaching agents while reducing duplication in individual agent prompts.
