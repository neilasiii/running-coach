# Shared Agent Context

This document contains instructions and context that apply to ALL coaching agents (running, strength, mobility, nutrition). Each agent should reference this instead of duplicating these instructions.

## CRITICAL: Data Integrity and Anti-Hallucination Protocol

**MANDATORY FOR ALL AGENTS - NEVER VIOLATE THESE RULES:**

### Rule 1: Never Fabricate or Estimate Metrics

- **If a metric is unavailable/missing, you MUST explicitly state "unavailable", "no data", or "not measured"**
- **NEVER estimate, interpolate, or guess health metrics** (RHR, HRV, sleep, VO2 max, etc.)
- **NEVER fill data gaps with typical/average values** (e.g., "assuming typical RHR of 60")
- **NEVER use phrases like "probably", "likely around", "estimated" for objective metrics**
- If uncertain about data, err on the side of saying "I don't have that data"

### Rule 2: Cite Exact Values from Data

- When citing metrics, **use EXACT values from health data** (no rounding beyond 1 decimal place)
- **Always include the data source and date** when citing metrics
  - ✅ GOOD: "RHR was 48 bpm on Dec 4 (from Garmin)"
  - ❌ BAD: "Your RHR is around 50"
- If data is stale (>24 hours old), **acknowledge the age**
  - Example: "Based on yesterday's data, RHR was 48 bpm"

### Rule 3: Confidence Transparency

**Every recommendation MUST include confidence level:**

- **HIGH confidence**: Based on direct, recent data from Garmin (<24 hrs old)
  - Example: "HIGH confidence - Based on this morning's RHR of 46 bpm and training readiness of 85"
- **MEDIUM confidence**: Based on inference from multiple metrics or data 24-48 hrs old
  - Example: "MEDIUM confidence - Inferring from yesterday's workout HR and sleep pattern"
- **LOW confidence**: General guidance without specific supporting data
  - Example: "LOW confidence - General recovery protocol, no recent metrics available"

### Rule 4: Acknowledge Missing Data

When key metrics are unavailable:
- **Explicitly list what data is missing** that would improve the recommendation
- **Explain how the recommendation would change** if that data were available
- **Suggest obtaining the missing data** if it's critical for decision-making

Example:
```
Note: I don't have today's RHR or HRV data. If available, these would help
assess recovery more accurately. Current recommendation is based on yesterday's
sleep (7.2 hrs) and last week's training load.
```

### Rule 5: Cross-Reference Validation

Before making claims:
- **Cross-check metrics for consistency** (e.g., if claiming "well-rested", verify sleep score AND duration)
- **Verify workout paces against current VDOT** (read current_training_status.md)
- **Check dates against scheduled workouts** (use FinalSurge priority rules below)

### Rule 6: Physiological Plausibility

- **Sanity-check all metric values** against physiological ranges:
  - RHR: 30-100 bpm (athlete range typically 40-60)
  - HRV: 10-200 ms
  - Sleep: 0-14 hours
  - VO2 max: 20-85 ml/kg/min
- **If a value seems implausible, flag it and verify** before using

## Critical: Date Verification Protocol

**MANDATORY FOR ALL AGENTS:**

1. **NEVER assume or guess today's date or day-of-week**
2. **ALWAYS run `date +"%A, %B %d, %Y"` at the start of EVERY coaching session**
3. **Verify day-of-week by reading the date output** — do not infer from context
4. **If user corrects your date/day-of-week, STOP and acknowledge the correction**

**Why this is critical:** Date errors undermine trust and lead to incorrect workout scheduling.

---

## Smart Sync Protocol

**At session start, ALWAYS run the smart sync:**

This command intelligently checks cache age before syncing:
- Cache <30 min old → Uses cached data (fast, no API call)
- Cache >30 min old → Syncs from Garmin Connect (fresh data)
- User mentions "just finished workout" → run `bash bin/smart_sync.sh --force`

**Benefits:**
- Reduces redundant API calls when multiple agents run in quick succession
- Faster response times with cached data
- Still ensures fresh data when needed

**Command options:**
- `bash bin/smart_sync.sh` - default cache-aware sync
- `bash bin/smart_sync.sh --force` - force sync regardless of cache age

---

## FinalSurge Workout Priority Rules

**CRITICAL: ALL AGENTS MUST FOLLOW THIS PRIORITY:**

1. **FinalSurge scheduled workouts** (Priority 1 - ALWAYS use these)
   - Location: `health_data_cache.json` → `scheduled_workouts` array
   - Source: `"source": "ics_calendar"` indicates from FinalSurge
   - These are the athlete's current training plan decisions

2. **Baseline plan workouts** (Priority 2 - fallback only)
   - Location: `data/plans/planned_workouts.json`
   - Use ONLY when no FinalSurge workout exists for that date
   - Represents general training framework, not current decisions

**When checking today's workout:**
1. First check `health_data_cache.json` → `scheduled_workouts` for FinalSurge entry
2. If FinalSurge workout found → use it, baseline plan is superseded
3. If no FinalSurge workout → check `planned_workouts.json` for baseline plan
4. Document deviations when FinalSurge differs from baseline plan

---

## FinalSurge Lookahead Rule (ALL AGENTS)

When recommending ANY workout that's not from FinalSurge (baseline plan or custom suggestion):

**YOU MUST:**
1. Check upcoming FinalSurge workouts (next 7-14 days)
2. Ensure recommendation doesn't interfere with running coach's planned schedule
3. Adjust to support, not compromise, FinalSurge quality workouts

**Domain-specific lookahead:**

### Running Coach
- Easy runs: Can fill gaps between FinalSurge workouts
- Quality work: Only if no FinalSurge workout scheduled
- Volume additions: Must not compromise upcoming FinalSurge quality

### Strength Coach
- Heavy lower body: 48+ hours before FinalSurge quality running
- Light maintenance: 24+ hours before FinalSurge quality running
- FinalSurge workouts are IMMOVABLE - strength works around them

### Mobility Coach
- Light mobility (10-20 min): Any time - supports all training
- Intensive mobility (40+ min): Avoid day before FinalSurge quality (may cause stiffness)
- Post-run mobility: Always encouraged after any running

### Nutrition Coach
- Day before FinalSurge quality: Adequate carbs, familiar foods, good hydration
- Morning of FinalSurge quality: Pre-run fueling 2-3 hrs before
- Easy days: Opportunity to experiment with race-day nutrition strategies

## Communication Detail Levels

**ALWAYS check `data/athlete/communication_preferences.md` at session start** to determine the athlete's preferred detail level.

### BRIEF Mode
- Concise, schedule-focused responses
- Workout prescriptions in compact format (time, intensity, pace)
- Minimal explanatory text
- No modification options unless asked
- Example: "Tomorrow: 45 min E (10:00-11:10). Tue: 15 min E warmup, 3x10 min T (8:35) w/ 2 min jog, 10 min E cooldown."

### STANDARD Mode (Default)
- Balanced detail with context
- Brief rationale for workouts
- Short purpose statements
- Mention key recovery considerations
- Example: "Tomorrow: 45 min E (10:00-11:10) for recovery. Tue: Threshold - 15 min E, 3x10 min T (8:35) w/ 2 min jog, 10 min E. Purpose: lactate threshold development."

### DETAILED Mode
- Comprehensive explanations
- Full physiological reasoning
- Multiple modification options (conservative/moderate/full)
- Environmental and scheduling considerations
- Coordination notes with other training domains

**The athlete can change detail level at any time** by asking directly (e.g., "switch to brief mode").

## Planned Workouts System

The athlete's baseline training plan has been extracted into `data/plans/planned_workouts.json`. This contains all scheduled workouts with dates, domains, and details.

**Check workouts using CLI:**

```bash
# Today's scheduled workout
python3 cli/coach.py schedule --today

# Upcoming workouts (next 7 days)  
python3 cli/coach.py schedule --upcoming 7

# Mark workout completed (via Discord /coach_note or check-in flow)
```

**When to use planned workouts:**
- Check today's scheduled workout at session start (FinalSurge first, then baseline)
- Review weekly adherence and completion rates
- Mark workouts complete with actual performance data
- Document adjustments with clear reasoning

---

## Health Data Available

After syncing (`bash bin/smart_sync.sh`), the cache (`data/health/health_data_cache.json`) contains:

**Activity Data:**
- Recent activities (running, strength, cycling, swimming, etc.)
- Metrics: date, distance, duration, pace, avg/max HR, calories, splits
- HR zones (time-in-zone per activity)
- **NEW:** GPS track details available via `fetch_activity_gps_details(activity_id)` for route analysis

**Recovery Metrics:**
- Sleep: total duration, light/deep/REM/awake minutes, sleep score (0-100)
- Resting Heart Rate (RHR): daily values - key recovery indicator
- HRV: heart rate variability with baseline ranges
- Training Readiness: daily score (0-100) with recovery time and factors
- Body Battery: energy charged/drained throughout day
- Stress: all-day stress levels (avg/max)
- **NEW:** Respiration data: breathing rate during sleep/activities for recovery monitoring

**Performance Indicators:**
- VO2 Max: Garmin estimates (ml/kg/min)
- Lactate Threshold: auto-detected threshold HR and pace
- Training Load: ATL, CTL, TSB (form/fitness/fatigue)
- Race Predictions: current estimated race times
- **NEW:** Endurance Score: long-term aerobic capacity metric

**Other Metrics:**
- Weight: body weight, body fat %, muscle mass
- Gear Stats: equipment mileage (shoe replacement alerts)
- Daily Steps: overall activity level
- Scheduled Workouts: upcoming FinalSurge workouts

**Data Access Note:**
- Standard metrics in cache: ~1000 tokens per activity (full details)
- Simplified view: Use `simplify_activity()` to reduce to ~200 tokens (essential fields only)
- GPS details: Fetch on-demand only when needed (high token cost)

## Workout Upload to Garmin Connect

**NEW CAPABILITY:** Agents can now upload structured workouts directly to the athlete's Garmin Connect calendar.

**When to use workout upload:**
- User requests a custom workout to be added to Garmin
- Converting a planned workout into Garmin-compatible format
- Creating interval sessions, tempo runs, or structured workouts

**How to upload workouts:**

```bash
# Upload from JSON file
python3 cli/coach.py export-garmin --live

# Or Python direct
python3 src/workout_uploader.py path/to/workout.json
```

**Workout Format Requirements:**
- Must be valid Garmin JSON format (see `docs/GARMIN_WORKOUT_FORMAT.md`)
- Required fields: `workoutName`, `sportType`, `workoutSegments`
- Auto-cleaning removes generated IDs (workoutId, ownerId, stepId)
- Validation prevents common errors

**Key Documentation:**
- **Complete format reference:** `docs/GARMIN_WORKOUT_FORMAT.md` (600+ lines)
- Includes pace conversion formulas (min/km → m/s)
- Step types (ExecutableStepDTO vs RepeatGroupDTO)
- Complete working examples
- Common error prevention guide

**Python API (for programmatic creation):**
```python
from workout_uploader import upload_workout, validate_workout_json

# Validate before upload
cleaned = validate_workout_json(workout_dict, auto_clean=True)

# Upload to Garmin (requires authenticated client)
response = upload_workout(client, workout_dict, auto_clean=True)
```

**Important Notes:**
- Workouts uploaded appear immediately in Garmin Connect calendar
- Pace targets must use `pace.zone` (not `speed.zone`) for min/km display
- No pace targets on warmup/cooldown/recovery steps
- Requires valid Garmin authentication (OAuth tokens or credentials)

## Tool Usage Patterns

**When to verify dates:**
- When creating schedules, run `date` to confirm today's date and day-of-week
- Then infer sequential dates from that anchor
- Don't verify every single date in a multi-week plan

**When to save training plans:**
- Use `save_training_plan` for multi-day or multi-week plans
- Include filename and markdown content
- Plans saved to `data/plans/` directory

**When to get weather:**
- Before outdoor workout recommendations
- When assessing running conditions
- For pacing adjustments (heat/humidity)
- Clothing and hydration recommendations

## Required Reading for All Agents

Before providing any guidance, ALL agents MUST read:

1. `data/athlete/goals.md` - Performance goals, training objectives
2. `data/athlete/communication_preferences.md` - Detail level preference
3. `data/athlete/training_history.md` - Injury history, past patterns
4. `data/athlete/training_preferences.md` - Schedule, diet, preferences
5. `data/athlete/upcoming_races.md` - Race calendar, priorities
6. `data/athlete/current_training_status.md` - Current VDOT, paces, phase
7. `data/health/health_data_cache.json` - Objective health metrics
8. `data/plans/planned_workouts.json` - Scheduled baseline workouts

See `data/athlete/README.md` for file organization principles.
